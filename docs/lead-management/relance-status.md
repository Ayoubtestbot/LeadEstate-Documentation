# üîÑ Relance Status - Enhanced Lead Pipeline

**New Lead Status for Improved Follow-up Management**

The "Relance" status has been added to the lead pipeline to provide better tracking of leads that require re-engagement or follow-up contact attempts.

## üéØ Purpose & Benefits

### **What is Relance?**
"Relance" (French for "relaunch" or "follow-up") is a new lead status positioned between "Contacted" and "Qualified" in the lead pipeline. It represents leads that have been initially contacted but require additional follow-up attempts before qualification.

### **Why Add Relance Status?**

- **Improved Follow-up Tracking**: Dedicated status for leads requiring re-engagement
- **Enhanced Reporting**: More granular analytics on lead progression
- **Team Coordination**: Better understanding of lead status across team members
- **Process Optimization**: Identify leads stuck in follow-up phase
